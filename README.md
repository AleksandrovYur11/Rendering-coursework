# Ray Tracing Rendering Engine

This is a coursework project focused on the development of a ray tracing rendering engine. The engine is based on the physics of light propagation. It takes input data such as light sources, geometry, material properties, and light sources.

This coursework implements ray tracing, a rendering technique that simulates the behavior of light rays as they interact with objects in a scene. The result of running the program is a file containing brightness data, which describes the brightness of each pixel in the scene.

This file can then be transformed into a real image using specialized software like Lumucept. Ray tracing is known for its ability to produce highly realistic images with accurate lighting and reflection effects, making it a popular choice in computer graphics and rendering applications.
